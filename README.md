# The Platform (Cryptokindness)

Cryptokindness aims to bridge the gap between the people and the city (government) to help make the state (town) a cleaner and better place. It's not to be confused with a smart city, it is an interface platform between the people and the government. The idea began with the use-case of garbage and then extended to other problems, as we worked on it.

## Usage 

The way the whole platform works is:

Take a place in your home town for example, where the garbage has been lying for a while now and it’s bothering not only you but a lot of other people as well. Simply, take a picture of it through our application on your phone, select the category as “Trash” and submit it.

The meta data of the image, the Geo-location, ID user and date primarily, will be taken and stored through a smart contract while the image will we stored in the form of hash at a government database for archive purposes. 

At this point, your task is done. Now, it’s time for other people do to the same exact thing. 

Once the smart contract registers that (let’s say) 10 people (threshold) have taken the photo of the same place (the reason why Geo-location was utilized), a flag (notification) will be sent to the government stating that the place requires cleaning or please take necessary actions.

But wait, there’s more and here’s where it gets interesting. 

When the government performs their part, they reward every person who contributed to that particular location with tokens. Tokens which don’t really have a monetary value but are used to avail discounts and features out of pubic services or restaurants within the city. 

So, now people have an incentive as well.

Simple.
